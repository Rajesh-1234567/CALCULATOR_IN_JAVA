Creating a simple calculator in Java can be a good exercise to learn about basic arithmetic operations and user input. 
This program prompts the user to enter two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /), and then it performs the corresponding calculation based on the operator. It also checks for division by zero.

Compile and run this Java program to use the calculator. It's a basic example and doesn't include error handling for various cases, but it's a good starting point for building a more robust calculator application.
